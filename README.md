# NBA-sponsors-growth-insights
The National Basketball Association (NBA) is a highly visible and commercially successful sports league. Understanding sponsor growth trends is crucial for the NBA to optimize its sponsorship programs and attract new partners. However, current methods for analyzing sponsor growth may lack a systematic approach or rely on qualitative assessments.
# This project aims to address this gap by using LDA, logistic regression, data analytics and machine learning concepts to forecast NBA sponsors growth.
